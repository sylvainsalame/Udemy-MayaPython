# Dictionaries are an association of a key and a value.
# In a real dictionary you'd have the word (key) and the definition (value)

# For the camera we will set None as we want to use it to indicate Camera's should have no suffix

# Here we create our first function.
# The word 'def' is used to define (def-ine) a function
# Following the def, is the name of the function
# In the parenthesis () we provide an argument, and give it an optional default value
# This means that when someone uses our function they can provide some input, but the default value means they don't have to.
#
# Following the function is some text in triple quotes. This is called a docstring.
# Docstrings are documentation on how to use the function and are a good practice to write so that people
#       can understand how to use your function without reading the code
